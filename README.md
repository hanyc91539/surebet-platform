## Surebet: Guide to Successful Sports Betting
For some people, sports betting can be a way to show their love for the sport. For others, however, the sole purpose is to become a winning player and in turn make a profit. However, it is quite difficult to find a strategy to beat a bookmaker, regardless of the outcome. Fortunately, we have one that we will tell you about in this article: surebet. Here are some tips that will help you have a winning bet fairly regularly.

## Illustrated, how to win with the surebet?
Example: Asian Handicap (AH) victory in a La Liga match
```
B 1 : AH1 (-1,5) = 1,84	AH2 (+1,5) = 2,14
```
```
B 2 : AH1 (-1,5) = 2,07	AH2 (+1.5) = 1.83
```
Above you can see the odds (Asian handicap) of a Spanish La Liga match from two different bookmakers. Of course, a normal bettor will not notice anything. However, a professional referee will notice that the Asian handicap (+1.5) of bookmaker 1 and the Asian handicap (-1.5) of bookmaker 2, both with odds above 2, are surebets. In simple terms, you are sure to win your bet by betting on both events simultaneously.

## Is finding a surebet a matter of chance?
Contrary to what one might think, the possibility of stumbling upon a surebet by chance is highly unlikely. However, for those who are aware of this technique, there are two possibilities: search manually or automatically.

Manually, it is up to you to proceed on a case by case basis by taking note of the different odds offered by different bookmakers on the same event. Of course, this method will require some time and some mathematical operations.

In order to save you from this more or less arduous process, several specialised software programmes offer to find surebets for you. Their role is to collect online information from several bookmakers in order to analyse it to reveal situations that can make you win money.

## Tips and Tricks for Winning a Surebet
Although the possibilities are small with sure bet, the techniques are usually profitable. You can be even more sure of winning your bets by following a strict guide to win. Firstly, make sure you don't get sucked into this technique and alternate regularly with regular bets. Secondly, make sure that the bookmaker you are surebetting with does not charge you more than a 3% deposit fee.
